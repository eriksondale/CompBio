# Computational Biology (Related) Scripts

This repository contains scripts that I write that somehow relate to computational biology. I hope to create a larger program in the future that will aggregate similar scripts (e.g. for DNA sequences) so that numerous operations can be executed using one file input. 

Some of these scripts are based on solving http://rosalind.info/ problems. Others I have written for making my work/research easier.
